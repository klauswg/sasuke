{% if predecessors.has_ai_dynamic_report_manifest %}
## AI-DYNAMIC full report manifest (read on demand)
The `reportManifest.path` in the predecessor `ai-dynamic-result` points to the complete internal execution report index, including node/group topology, dependencies and timing, workspaces, internal summaries, and attachment locators. By default, use the business handoff `summary`; read the manifest only when you need to verify internal execution, locate report attachments, or the `summary` lacks required detail.
