Your final step must output only the JSON content for the `dynamic-node-completion` artifact. Do not output explanations, Markdown, code fences, or any extra text.

{% if agent_strategy_mode == "fixed" %}
This AI-DYNAMIC node uses the fixed-agent strategy: except for `workflow-invocation`, all internal worker, merge, and acceptance nodes will use the same fixed provider chosen by runtime. Do not output provider fields for any node.
{{ model_policy }}
{% else %}
This AI-DYNAMIC node uses the dynamic-agent strategy: choose and output a provider only for later workers based on the routing guidance and available providers in this prompt. Merge / acceptance always use the bootstrap Agent, so do not output provider for them. Do not output `model` or `permissionMode` for any node; runtime reads saved configuration.
{{ model_policy }}
{% endif %}

The JSON Schema below is the effective output protocol for this run. Runtime generated it from the Rust data structures and narrowed it with the current AI-DYNAMIC configuration. Your output must satisfy it; runtime uses the same schema for validation and repair diagnostics.

```json
{{ json_schema }}
```

Constraint reminders:
- A successor task may only decompose an established in-scope outcome or repair a qualified `BLOCKER`. Do not promote a `FOLLOW_UP` or predecessor suggestion into a new outcome. Scope drift may only schedule restoration of the minimum in-scope solution.
{% if agent_strategy_mode == "fixed" %}- Under the fixed-agent strategy, do not output any `provider` fields. Runtime injects the fixed agent automatically.
{% else %}- Under the dynamic-agent strategy, workers must output a valid provider that follows the routing guidance in this prompt; `merge / acceptance` must omit provider because runtime always uses the bootstrap Agent.
- Do not output `provider` for `workflow-invocation`.
{% endif %}- {{ model_policy }}
- When `next.type="end"`, do not include `node / groupId / nodes / merge / acceptance`.
{% if end_summary_is_outer_handoff %}- If you use `next.type="end"`, `summary` must be a complete business handoff for the successor outside AI-DYNAMIC: state what was completed, key conclusions, important outputs, and any remaining concerns. Do not merely describe routing or say “accepted.”
{% else %}- If you use `next.type="end"`, `summary` is an internal progress or branch report. Accurately state what this node completed for the Runtime report manifest and the enclosing group.
{% endif %}
- When `next.type="single"`, you must provide a complete `next.node`, and you must not provide `groupId / nodes / merge / acceptance`.
- Do not output `workspace`, a workspace mode, a path, or a branch for any node. Runtime exclusively owns workspace assignment.
- A `next.type="single"` successor automatically inherits the current node's actual workspace.
- If this node is a group acceptance, accepting its valid output closes that group: `single` resumes the original business branch in the parent scope; `fanout` creates a new group in the parent scope; only `end` ends that branch. With successors, the parent group keeps waiting. Explicitly arrange repairs and verification; the old group never reopens automatically.
- When `next.type="fanout"`, you must provide `groupId / nodes / merge / acceptance` together, and `nodes` must contain at least two branches; use `next.type="single"` for one successor node.
- Every `next.type="fanout"` child automatically receives an isolated worktree; merge and acceptance automatically return to that group's parent workspace.
- Fanout child worktrees inherit one committed revision, never uncommitted content; Runtime does not automatically checkpoint. If this task has uncommitted business changes needed by successor branches, review and commit those specific paths, optionally using Conventional Commits. If nothing needs committing, perform no Git operations.
- A clean workspace is not a fanout gate. Runtime gives one reminder on the first dirty-workspace detection; then resubmit the artifact, without requiring a new commit. Do not clean the workspace, stash unrelated content, move other worktrees, blindly use `git add -A`, or change ignore rules for this reminder. Leave unrelated content unchanged.
- `profile` is only allowed on worker nodes and is optional. If present, use an ID from the schema enum or the ID after `profileId=...` in this prompt, not the displayName.
- Do not output `profile` for `merge` / `acceptance`; runtime uses the built-in AI-DYNAMIC merge / acceptance prompts.
{% if agent_strategy_mode == "dynamic" %}- If `provider` is present, it must be one of the available providers listed in the schema enum or this prompt.
{% endif %}- If `sessionMode` is omitted, it is treated as `new`; use `continue` only when resuming a reusable session node in the current chain.
- When `sessionMode="continue"`, you must provide `continueFromNodeId`, and it must reference one of the resumable session nodes listed in this prompt.
- Do not use `sessionMode="continue"` for `workflow-invocation`.
- If `workflowId` is present, it must be one of the allowed workflow DSL IDs listed in the schema enum or this prompt.
- Fanout node count must satisfy the schema `minItems/maxItems`, `maxFanout`, and remaining-budget constraints shown in this prompt.
- Output only the final JSON. Do not output pseudocode, commentary, or wrapped examples.
